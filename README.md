# Gender-and-the-Acoustic-Vowel-Space

This study explores differences in female and male production of English vowels.    
While many phoneticians have observed differences in the sizes of the female and male acoustic vowel space, 
the reasons for these differences are uncertain.  
Cardinal vowels and their formant frequencies are analyzed in three types of speech.  
Results show that differences in acoustic vowel space cannot be entirely explained by differences in fundamental frequency, 
and that speakers effectively manipulate vowel space size when imitating the speech of the opposite gender.  
These conclusions have implications for future research into the physical and social causes of gender differences in speech.
